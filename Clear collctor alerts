All,
You can use these two update statements against Central Services to clear collectors which are marked as outage when they shouldnâ€™t be.

It should work for both mesh and mesh ip but I have only tested on Mesh IP.  All you need to do is replace with the correct collector id.

--Use to clear collector alerts if they are set incorrectly
update collectoralerts2 set lastalertdate=NULL where systemmetricid=53 and collectorid=4
update collectoralerts2 set lastalertdate=NULL where systemmetricid=62 and collectorid=4

Thanks, James
